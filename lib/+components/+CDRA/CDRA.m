    %% Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) Subsystem File
    % Alternative Name: 4BMS or 4 Bed Molecular Sieve
    %
    % The ISS uses two CDRAs as part of the US life support systems. One is
    % located in Node 3 and the other in the US Lab (normally only one CDRA
    % is working at the same time). Each CDRA gets air from a Common Cabin
    % Air Assembly (CCAA) that has first passed through a condesing heat
    % exchanger to remove most of the humidity in the air. This is done
    % because the adsorption of water and CO2 on zeolite would favor wator
    % instead of CO2. The CDRA itself consists of 4 adsorber beds of which
    % 2 are used to remove CO2 while the others are used to remove the
    % remaining humidity before the CO2 adsorbing beds.

            % the previous incompressible pressure based solver, and see
            % how well that works, then setting the smaller timestep as the
            % overall system step but keeping two seperate time steps for
            % desorption part and adsorption part

            % created by the pump to remove air from CDRA and back into the
            % cabin during the 10 minute duration. The parameter that has
            % to be fitted to test data is the pressure created by the pump
            %
            % After that the actual desorption starts, for that the
            % pressure at the outlet should be set close to zero (do not
            % take the exit phase pressure) and the calculation should
            % simply decide what the flowrate is. Once the pressure in the
            % phase is low enough the calculation can switch to a simpler
            % calculation that just keeps the phase masses constant.
